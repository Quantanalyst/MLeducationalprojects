## Computer Vision Basics





**The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC)**

The PASCAL VOC project:
  * Provides standardised image data sets for object class recognition
  * Provides a common set of tools for accessing the data sets and annotations
  * Enables evaluation and comparison of different methods 
  * Ran challenges evaluating performance on object class recognition (from 2005-2012, now finished)

**ImageNet**

The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in **visual object recognition software research**. More than 14 million images have been **hand-annotated** by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided. ImageNet contains more than 20,000 categories with a typical category, such as "balloon" or "strawberry", consisting of several hundred images. The database of annotations of third-party image URLs is freely available directly from ImageNet, though the actual images are not owned by ImageNet. Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes. The challenge uses a "trimmed" list of one thousand non-overlapping classes.


Training by CUDA:

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia.It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing. The CUDA platform is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU's virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.
