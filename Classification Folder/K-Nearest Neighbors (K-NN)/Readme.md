## K-Nearest Neighbor classification

KNN is a nonlinear classifier and it follows the below steps:
  * step 1) choose the number K of neighbors
  * step 2) take the K nearest neighbors of the new data point, according to Euclidean distance (or other distances like Manhattan distance, â€¦ )
  * step 3) among these K neighbors, count the number of data points in each category
  * step 4) assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbors
