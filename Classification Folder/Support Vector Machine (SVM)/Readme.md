## Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions, e.g. **linear**, **nonlinear**, **polynomial**, **radial basis function (RBF)**, and **sigmoid**.

What makes SVM special?
  * Support vectors. Support vectors are instances that are very extreme. They are the closest members to the opposite class and they would be used to define the separator that classify our samples into different classes. 
  * Moreover, another special property of SVM is kernels, which gives you a lot of flexibility. For example, if you use linear kernel, your classifier becomes linear and if you use nonlinear kernel like radial basis function, it become nonlinear.
