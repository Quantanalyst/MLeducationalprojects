## Random Forest

There are many classification algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, naive Bayes classifier, and decision trees. But near the top of the classifier hierarchy is the Random Forest.

The **random forest** is a classification algorithm consisting of many decisions trees. It uses 1. **bagging** and 2. **feature randomness** when building each individual tree to try to create an **uncorrelated** forest of trees whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.
