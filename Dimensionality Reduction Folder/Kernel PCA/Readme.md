## Kernel PCA

Both PCA and LDA are linear. It means that they only can separate the data if the data itself is linearly separable. However, they fail to function when the data is not linearly separable. In order to solve this problem, we can use some kernels, which means we can apply some functions to take the data into a higher dimension where the data can be linearly separable.
