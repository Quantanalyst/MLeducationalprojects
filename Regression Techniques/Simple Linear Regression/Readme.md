### Assumptions of Linear Regression: 
For linear regression to work, it needs to have certain properties. Lack of these properties affect the outcome of OLS calculations. 
Assumptions: 

* **Linearity**
  * There must be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
  * Scatterplots can show whether there is a linear or curvilinear relationship.
* **Homoscedasticity** 
  * This assumption means that the variance around the regression line is the same for all values of the independent variable (X).
  * Heteroscedasticity is a systematic change in the spread of the residuals over the range of measured values. 
  * Heteroscedasticity is a problem because ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes that all residuals are drawn from a population that has a constant variance (homoscedasticity).
* **Multivariate Normality**
  * Multiple regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.
* **Independence of Errors**
* **Lack of Multicollinearity**
  * Multiple regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.
