## Regularization 

In machine learning, **regularization** is the process of adding information in order to prevent **overfitting**. Regularization applies to loss functions. One of the ways of avoiding overfitting is using cross validation, that helps in estimating the error over test set, and in deciding what parameters work best for your model.
