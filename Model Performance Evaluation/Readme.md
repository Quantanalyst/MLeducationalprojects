## Model Performance Evaluation methods

There are many ways to assess the performance of different ML algorithms. In this section, some of them are briefly explained. 

Classification methods:
Below are methods used to evaluate the performance of classification methods.
* CAP curve (Cumulative Accuracy Profile)
  * The CAP Curve tries to analyse how to effectively identify all data points of a given class using minimum number of tries.

* ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristics)
  * The True Positive Rate (TPR) is plot against False Positive Rate (FPR) for the probabilities of the classifier predictions. Then, the area under the plot is calculated.
* Precision and Recall metrics
